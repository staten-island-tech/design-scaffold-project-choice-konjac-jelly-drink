<p>The nano pouch, crafted in blue Dior Oblique jacquard, honors the Saddle line's emblematic codes with its asymmetric flap and antique gold-finish metal 'D' stirrup. A staple of the women's wardrobe, the accessory is ideal for all the daily essentials. The miniature pouch has a removable chain and may be carried by hand, worn over the shoulder or crossbody.</p>
<p>The Dio(r)evolution ring is both modern and timeless. Made with gold-finish metal, the style proudly features a central 'DIOR' signature with a crystal pavé. The ring can be paired with other Dio(r)evolution creations.</p>
<p>The Dway slide has a timeless and emblematic silhouette. The slide's upper features a deep blue embroidered 'CHRISTIAN DIOR' signature and instantly stands out. The streamlined shoe slips on easily and offers effortless style.</p>
<p>Echoing its inspiring character, the new Miss Dior fragrance is like an olfactory “millefiori”. Centifolia Rose, with its honeyed and peppery notes, reigns over a delectably creamy velvet heart. It is embroidered with fresh Lily-of-the-Valley notes, an apricot-tinged Peony accord, and powdery Iris notes.</p>
<p>Dior Addict Stellar Halo Shine is the iconic Dior lip shine with a new starry center. This Dior lucky star highlights the colour with a newfound halo shimmer. This balm glides on with incredible sensoriality and instantly melts on contact with the lips.</p>
