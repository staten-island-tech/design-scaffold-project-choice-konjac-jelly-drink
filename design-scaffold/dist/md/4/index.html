        <p>The Dway slide has a timeless and emblematic silhouette. The slide's upper features a deep blue embroidered 'CHRISTIAN DIOR' signature and instantly stands out. The streamlined shoe slips on easily and offers effortless style.</p>
<p>&quot;Dway slides are simple, no-fuss slippers from Dior. They're entirely embroidered; they feature the Christian Dior logo front and center, and have leather insoles, making them less prone to dirt and decay due to friction. These are no-nonsense slides that come in a variety of colors and patterns, and are designed for comfort and overall easy wear. They closely resemble the Chez Moi slides, which also feature ultra-thin soles, but the Dway is slightly higherâ€”if you look closely, you'll notice that it has a bit of a platform at the heel. Additionally, the Chez Moi bears the Dior Oblique canvas, while the Dway bears the Christian Dior logo, spelled out.&quot; -Sophia G. de Aros</p>
